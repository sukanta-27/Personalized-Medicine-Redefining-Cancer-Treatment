We have two data files: one conatins the information about the genetic mutations and the other contains the clinical evidence (text) that human experts/pathologists use to classify the genetic mutations.

## Type of Machine Learning Problem
There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified into => Multi class classification problem
